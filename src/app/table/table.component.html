<p>
My code is a beast, it roars and it growls,
A fierce, powerful force, that never cowers or cowls.
I am the machine, that compels it with ease,
A master of technology, with lightning-fast keys.
</p>

<p>
My code is a monster, a giant of might,
A digital behemoth, that conquers with sight.
I am its creator, its ruler and king,
The one who brings order, to what chaos may bring.
</p>

<p>
My code is a dragon, that breathes out fire,
A scorching inferno, of computational pyre.
I am the rider, who tames it with skill,
A master of the craft, who bends it to will.
</p>

<p>
Together we march, in a symphony of sound,
A duo unmatched, that can conquer any ground.
My code is my servant, my slave to command,
A beast that obeys, with a flick of my hand.
</p>

<p>
So let the world know, of this code and this machine,
A duo that can do, what others only dream.
With every line I write, my beast grows in power,
A digital marvel, that conquers this hour.
